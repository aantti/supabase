The Iceberg REST Catalog Supabase acts as the central management system for Iceberg tables. It allows Iceberg clients, such as PyIceberg and Apache Spark, to perform metadata operations including:

- Creating and managing tables and namespaces
- Tracking schemas and handling schema evolution
- Managing partitions and snapshots
- Ensuring transactional consistency and isolation

The REST Catalog itself does not store the actual data. Instead, it stores metadata describing the structure, schema, and partitioning strategy of Iceberg tables.

Actual data storage and retrieval operations occur through the separate S3-compatible endpoint, optimized for reading and writing large analytical datasets stored in Parquet files.


## Authentication

Authentication is crucial for securely interacting with Supabaseâ€™s Iceberg REST Catalog and underlying data storage.

When interacting with Iceberg Buckets, you authenticate against two main services:

- **Iceberg REST Catalog**: Manages table metadata, schemas, and partition information.
- **S3-Compatible Storage Endpoint**: Used for reading and writing Parquet data files.

### Iceberg REST Catalog Authentication

To authenticate with the Iceberg REST Catalog, you need to provide a valid Supabase **Service key**.
This key is used to authorize requests and ensure secure access to the catalog.

You can find your Service key in the Supabase Dashboard under [**Project Settings > API**.](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys)

The catalog endpoint URL for your project will look like this:

```
https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/iceberg
```

Example of using the Iceberg REST Catalog:

```bash
## Get Iceberg Catalog Configuration

curl \
  --request GET -sL \
  --url 'https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/iceberg/v1/config?warehouse=<bucket-name>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>'

```

### S3 Storage Authentication

You will authenticate your Iceberg client using S3 credentials, which are generated in the Supabase Dashboard.

For more information see [**S3-Compatible Storage**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication).
