Iceberg Buckets are specialized Supabase Storage buckets powered by Apache Iceberg, an open-table format for efficiently managing analytical datasets.

Iceberg ensures scalable, robust, and performant management of massive analytical datasets, supporting advanced features such as schema evolution, snapshot isolation, efficient partitioning, incremental data updates, and transactional guarantees.

You interact with Iceberg Buckets through clients such as PyIceberg or Apache Spark, which communicate with Supabase via a REST Catalog interface. Iceberg buckets enable analytical queries over large datasets stored in Parquet files optimized for analytics.


## Create your first ICEBERG Bucket

To create an Iceberg Bucket, you can use the Supabase SDK or the Supabase Dashboard.

### Using the Supabase SDK

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient('https://your-project.supabase.co', 'your-anon-key')

supabase.storage.createBucket('analytics', {
  type: 'ICEBERG',
})
```

### Using the Supabase Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Storage section in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Click on "Create Bucket".
3. Enter a name for your bucket (e.g., `analytics`).
4. Select "Iceberg" as the bucket type.
